[/b]\nNow that can is out the way...\n\n[h1]Welcome and getting started![/h1]\nWe at CoA decided to \"expand\" our reach through our furnishing for now.\nTo obtain them: Craft the noticeboard, or if you're lazy [strike]/spawnitem coa_bountyboard[/strike]\nFrom there, you'll have a decent sized selection of furnishings, wall mounts and crates to store your well earned loot!\n\n[h1]The meat[/h1]\nAs stated, the mod is furnishing atm. Please be patient with us as we do have plans to expand this.\n\n[h1]Q&A[/h1]\n\"Is this compatible with my polly pocket playhouse?\"\nYes, there shouldn't be any conflicts with this mod and any other as far as we can tell you.\n\n\"If I remove the mod during a playthrough, will it brick my character?\"\nNo, but it'll hurt us and maybe cause you to crash once. To prevent that, destroy/delete everything in game that belongs to our mod and you should be safe to uninstall the mod.\n\n\"I want X and X and X and so and so\"\nExcuse me, this is a mod, not a burgerking.\n\n\"I my friend keeps crashing as he joins me when I have this mod on, why is that? Maybe your mod is broken.\"\nR E A D  T H E  D I S C L A I M E R\n\n\"Discord? Discord? Discord?\"\nShhhhh... shhh, it's okay little one.\nhttps://discord.gg/8jfYtJF\nIt's right here.",
